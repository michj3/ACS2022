# ACS2022

This repository is for the work done on ACS 2022 data by Fatima Yunusa, Michelle Ji, Jiaqi Lai, Lexi Knight, and Aliza Mithwani. This repo consists of a qmd file and the rendered pdf file, consisting of information on how we got our data from IPUMS USA and general information on the ratio of Laplace. Using known information on California respondents, we use the ratio of Laplace to estimate the total number of respondents for each state. Finally, we discuss why there may be potential variations between the estimated number and actual number of respondents. 

# LLM Usage
We used ChatGPT4 in aspects of this project to understand what ratio of Laplace is. Full chat history is in the folder `llm`.
